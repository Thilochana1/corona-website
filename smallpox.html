                <p>
                    Smallpox is an acute contagious disease caused by the variola virus, 
                    a member of the orthopoxvirus family. It was one of the most devastating 
                    diseases known to humanity and caused millions of deaths before it was eradicated. 
                    It is believed to have existed for at least 3000 years.  

                    The smallpox vaccine, created by Edward Jenner in 1796, was the first 
                    successful vaccine to be developed. He observed that milkmaids who previously 
                    had caught cowpox did not catch smallpox and showed that a similar inoculation 
                    could be used to prevent smallpox in other people.
